Digital is like an endless torrent. Far from being a quiet, peaceful river, it seeps in even where it's not expected. As a result, some companies are bailing water from all sides. But without stopping the leaks, the effort is endless, and the outcome inevitable.

Uberization is a lesson for our world. A brutal response to inaction, to harmful collusions, to the failure to address real issues. It solves the impossible equation, and like water, abhors a vacuum.

For those who see this phenomenon as a plague, I would tell them that you don't get "uberized" by magic. Uberization corrects the failures of a market and its players.

As a surge of pride, digital transformation will undoubtedly be the buzzword of the year. So we'll have to bail water regardless of the size of the boat or the extent of the damage.

We're going to "digitize" excessively. This will, I hope, shed light on the real difficulties that organizations and their employees face. Because they are the ones who will bear the burden. And let us remember that there are still too many disengaged employees at work. The love affair is over, the divorce is final, and the reality is stark:

- Inequities of all kinds
- Managerial shortcomings
- Digital-induced pressure
- Permanent velocity
- Etc.

Out of fear of being uberized, many organizations will embark on a transformation that few will master. A large majority will make this journey without any real sense of embodiment, truth, transparency, or trust.

Expected result: a failed transformation, allowing tomorrow's *ubers* to meet the expectations of a market that incumbents no longer control.

How can we reverse the trend? Take the leap, stop being afraid, and move fast. The stakes? Transform or die.

Should we innovate? Absolutely. But not just in the services we offer. Put all your strength into your means of action, your organization, your management principles. No more organizational rigidity, no more time for endless reflection, no more command & control—make way for action, courage, tinkering, and finding joy in work.
