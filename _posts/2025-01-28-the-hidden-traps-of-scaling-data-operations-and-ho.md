Scaling data operations isn’t easy, but most obstacles are predictable and avoidable. After speaking with current or ex-Head of Data/CTO/CEO or CPO from companies like [La Belle Vie](https://www.labellevie.com/), [BSport](https://pro.bsport.io/), [Qare](https://www.qare.fr/), [Sunday](https://sundayapp.com/fr/) or [LeBonCoin](https://www.leboncoin.fr/), one thing is clear: the biggest challenges are often self-inflicted. From messy governance to tech stacks that don’t scale, let’s skip the fluff and dive straight into what works (and what doesn’t).


## 1. Centralize now, specialize later


Don’t overthink it. Early on, you need a small, centralized team that can enforce governance and standardize processes. Skip the urge to hire specialists. Get the basics right first — clean pipelines, solid reporting and clear ownership. When the time comes to expand, specialize your team around key business needs.

**⚠️ Trap to avoid:** Creating silos too early by scattering specialists across teams

**💡** **Actionable tip:** Start with generalists using flexible tools like dbt or Looker. Specialize only when your operational load demands it


## 2. Pick a tech stack that scales


Your tools should never hold you back. If you’re still using outdated solutions, you’re already behind. The modern data stack is cloud-based, modular, and designed for growth. Think Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks. Stop patching systems together and invest in tech that’ll save you headaches down the road.

**⚠️Trap to avoid:** Locking yourself into rigid, legacy systems

**💡Actionable tip:** Map out where your business will be in three years. Choose tools that can handle 10x the data volume you’re working with today


## 3. Governance is non-negotiable


It’s tempting to leave governance for “later.” Don’t, please. By the time you realize you need it, it’ll be too late. Strong governance ensures trust, security, and compliance. Start small: standardized data definitions, access controls, and audit trails. Build from there.

**⚠️Trap to avoid:** Scrambling to retrofit governance when regulations hit

**💡Actionable tip:** Implement automated tools like Monte Carlo or CastorDoc to monitor data quality and compliance from day one


## 4. Data must serve business goals


If your data isn’t driving decisions, what’s the point? Forget dashboards no one reads or non-actionable so-called KPIs with no impact. Your data should be laser-focused on solving business-critical problems. Tie every data initiative to clear, measurable outcomes.

**⚠️Trap to avoid:** Becoming a request factory for ad-hoc requests

**💡Actionable tip:** Say no to low-value. Instead, build scalable solutions that answer recurring questions


## 5. Balance your team


Too many juniors, and progress slows to a crawl. Too many seniors, and your budget implodes. The key is balance. Juniors need mentorship; seniors need to stay focused on high-impact tasks. Keep your team lean but effective.

**Trap to avoid:** Thinking more headcount means more output

**💡Actionable tip:** Pair every junior hire with a senior mentor to fast-track learning and autonomy


## No excuses. Scale smart


Scaling isn’t about luck; it’s about preparation. The biggest mistakes happen when teams try to rush without a solid foundation. Centralize first, invest in scalable tech, enforce governance, and focus on business impact. If you’re not doing this, your data operations aren’t ready to scale.
