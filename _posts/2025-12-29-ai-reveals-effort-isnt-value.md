Scott Adams has a simple [hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/live/y5ZkIDUuHAM): **laziness** isn't a lack of energy. It's a **cognitive bug**, the habit of focusing on cost rather than benefit.

BJ Fogg says [something similar](https://youtu.be/AdKUJxjn-R8) with his "tiny habits": **reduce friction to initiate behavior**.

But what happens when **friction collapses**? AI just did that.

It drives the execution cost of many tasks down to nearly nothing. And suddenly, the naked question appears: **where was the benefit, exactly?**

What's cruel for many tasks and professions is that they derived their **legitimacy from the effort required, not the value produced**. Effort was the **perceived value**. And someone was billing for it.

When you reduce friction on something with no real payoff, you don't create a habit. You expose a **void**.

Laziness isn't the problem. It's the symptom and AI is the revealer.
