## Laziness: Cognitive Bug or Warning Signal?

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/live/y5ZkIDUuHAM?si=FOb7B9Oj-9lug93J), Scott Adams poses a hypothesis as simple as it is unsettling: **laziness isn't a lack of energy**. It's a cognitive bug — the habit of thinking about cost rather than benefit.

BJ Fogg, with his ["tiny habits"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8), says something similar: reduce friction to initiate a behavior. But what happens when friction drops to zero?

## AI: The Great Revealer

AI just did that. It brings the cost of many tasks down to almost nothing. And suddenly, **the naked question emerges**: where exactly was the benefit?

What's cruel for many tasks — and many professions — is that they derived their legitimacy from the effort required, not from the value produced. **Effort was the perceived value.**

## The Exposed Void

When you reduce friction on something that has no real payoff, you don't create a habit — **you expose a void**.

Laziness isn't the problem. It's the symptom.
**AI is the revealer.**
