A hockey goalie on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46425198) nailed it:

> What matters more than where the puck is, is where it's going to be in two seconds. If you can't see the puck, look at the players. As a last resort, look at the ref. 99% of the time they'll be looking at the puck.

Someone [wrote](https://circusscientist.com/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/) that Google Ads gave them 5x their monthly budget as a bonus. **Zero return.**

Google is dead, they say. Where do we go now?

**Wrong question.**

Your customers aren't gone. They're just elsewhere. Maybe on ChatGPT. Maybe reading AI summaries at the top of Google. Maybe in Discord servers you'll never find. Maybe on TikTok, watching a 30-second video that answers their question better than your SEO-optimized blog post ever did.

The real problem isn't "where did Google go?" It's that **15 years of easy traffic made us forget how to find customers**.

Google Ads was the yellow pages on steroids. You paid, you appeared, they clicked. No need to understand *why* they bought. Just increase the budget.

That era created **intellectual laziness**. Why do focus groups when you can A/B test headlines? Why talk to customers when you can read analytics dashboards?

Now the shortcut is gone. And the naked question appears: **did you ever know why people bought from you?**

The game hasn't changed. It's still **leveraging attention**. The tactics shift:
- Yellow pages: start your business name with "A"
- Google: buy keywords
- Now: be the source the AI cites. Be in the private conversations.

The puck moved. Everyone's confused.

But look where the players are looking. Look where the ref is looking.

**Pick up your phone. Do a focus group. Find your customers.**

They're not gone. You just stopped watching the game.
