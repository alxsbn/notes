excerpt: "In 1859, Baudelaire called photography 'art's most mortal enemy' and demanded it remain a servant. In 2025, the same arguments echo about AI and code. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes."

The debates about AI replacing programmers feel **unprecedented**. Urgent. Existential.

They're not. We've been here before.

**166 years ago**, when photography arrived, the art world had the exact same meltdown.

## 1859: Art's most mortal enemy

Charles Baudelaire, writing in the *Revue Française*, absolutely **despised** photography:

> "As the photographic industry was the **refuge of all failed painters, too ill-equipped or too lazy** to complete their studies, this universal infatuation bore not only the character of blindness and imbecility, but also the color of vengeance."

> "This industry, by **invading the territories of art, has become art's most mortal enemy**."

His conclusion? Photography must "**return to its proper duty which consists in being a servant** to the sciences and the arts."

Sound familiar?

- "Refuge of failed painters, too lazy" → criticisms of AI users today
- "Art's most mortal enemy" → what people say about AI and coding
- "Must remain a servant" → "AI should just be a copilot"

But here's the twist.

## 1862: The League Against Photography

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, established master of French academic painting, **founded the "League of Artists Against Photography"** and led a formal "Protest by great artists against any assimilation of photography to art."

The irony? **Ingres himself used photography** to assist his paintings.

He saw the threat. Used the tool. But publicly fought to keep it subordinate.

Ingres remains a towering figure in art history. His paintings hang in the Louvre. But his **resistance to photography**?

Forgotten. Irrelevant. History moved on without him.

## The ones who won: those born with the camera

The **Impressionists**:
- Claude Monet (born 1840, **1 year after** the daguerreotype)
- Pierre-Auguste Renoir (born 1841)
- Paul Cézanne (born 1839, **the same year** photography was invented)

They didn't grow up mourning the "golden age of realistic painting." For them, photography **was just there**. Reality.

No baggage to drop. Nothing to unlearn.

So they invented something **the camera couldn't do**: impressionism, post-impressionism, eventually cubism and abstraction.

They didn't fight photography. They **made it irrelevant** by going where it couldn't follow.

## Today's impressionists

The pattern is repeating.

Senior developers—years of experience, battle-tested expertise—often resist AI coding tools the hardest. Not because they're wrong about code quality. But because they have **the most to lose**.

Years of muscle memory. Reflexes. Craft pride tied to "writing elegant code."

Meanwhile, new developers arriving today don't carry that weight. AI coding tools **are just there**. Reality. Not a threat to unlearn around.

They don't debate whether AI-generated code is "real programming."

They just ask: **"What can I build with this?"**

The seniors who **let go** will evolve. Like the academic painters who adapted, shifted focus, found new value beyond technical execution.

The ones who hold the line? History has already written their story. It's called the League Against Photography.

## The question

Ingres' paintings still hang in museums. But his **League Against Photography**? Forgotten. A historical curiosity.

The Impressionists didn't fight the camera. They **defined modern art**.

The skill that matters now isn't defending the old craft. It's **letting go** to discover what comes next.

Which side are you on?
